Course assignment 10/23

This process has been fun and very challenging.
I've definitely learned a lot and have a lot of ideas for how I would change my approach for the next assignment.
I think it's one of those things where you won't truly learn it all until you've banged your head against the wall a few times trying to figure things out first.
However I suppose I am happy with what I have achieved, even knowing there are a few things I could have improved on if I'd managed my time better and had a differently structured approach.
Also shoutout to Kjetil, Thomas and Ingrid amongst others for helping out and being generous with their time and knowledge as always. 
I'm not entirely sure what else to put here. :)
